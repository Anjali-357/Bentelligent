This JavaScript code includes several functions that enhance the functionality of a webpage. Let's break down the code and explain each part:

'use strict';:
This statement enforces a stricter set of rules and error handling in JavaScript. It helps catch common coding errors and prevents the use of certain error-prone features.
addEventOnelem Function:

This function is designed to add an event listener to one or multiple elements.
Parameters:
elem: The element or elements to which the event listener will be added.
type: The type of event (e.g., 'click', 'scroll').
callback: The function to be executed when the event occurs.

toggleNavbar Function:
Toggles the "active" class on the navbar and navToggler elements, creating a toggle effect for a responsive navigation bar.
Navbar Interaction:
Event listeners are added to the navToggler to trigger the toggleNavbar function on a click event.
Event listeners are added to each navbar link to close the navbar when a link is clicked.

activeHeader Function:
Adds or removes the "active" class on the header element based on the user's scroll position. If the scroll position is greater than 100 pixels, the "active" class is added; otherwise, it is removed.
Header Scroll Interaction:
An event listener is added to the window to trigger the activeHeader function on a scroll event.

Filter Tab Interaction:
Event listeners are added to each tab card to trigger the navigateTab function on a click event.
The navigateTab function removes the "active" class from the last clicked tab and adds it to the current tab.

Comments throughout the code provide explanations for each function, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand the purpose of each block of code
